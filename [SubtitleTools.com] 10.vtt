00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.360
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.360
What?

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.280
Nothing.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.440
Are you all right?

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.800
I mean, was it...

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.280
Yes.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.440
It was different

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.200
to what I thought.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.880
Oh...

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.600
A good different?

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.320
Yes. No, I didn't mean it was...

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:47.880
It was lovely.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.880
- Was...
- No. Uh, yes.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.040
Amazing.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.160
Really.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.360
- Really?
- Yes.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.920
Do I snore?

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Like a Viking horn.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.040
- Really?
- Mm.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.200
You know, you make these whimpering
puppy noises

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.280
- when you sleep.
- That's not true.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.480
Are you serious?

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.360
No.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.360
You were quiet.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:33.720
Peaceful.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.520
Very beautiful.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.000
You do know that?

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:43.720
And you.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.920
- Don't say it.
- No, you can't go.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.960
- I have to.
- No.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.200
- What happens if Pendragon betrays you?
- Then you must help protect the Fey.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.240
They don't trust me.
They follow Gawain. They won't...

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.560
Fire! Fire!

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.640
What happened?

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.880
His throat was cut first,

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.480
then he was burned.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.400
This is Wroth and his blood vow.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.560
My queen, the Fauns demand justice.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.080
Do we have proof?

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.760
Wroth has claimed the southern gate road

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.840
and threatened to kill any Fey
that agree to this Pendragon offer.

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.160
My men have already been fired upon
this morning.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.240
Nimue is offering her life
for these ships.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.320
To refuse them is death.
I'll go see Wroth.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.560
This is my doing. I'll go.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.600
I can't risk anything happening to you.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.360
Get the others in the square
and ready to march.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.360
The Fey are getting on those ships today.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.600
Hello, brother.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.320
Be safe, brother.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.560
Excuse me, sir.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.440
I cannot sway you from this cause?

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.560
This cause is a handful of sand
slipping through my fingers.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:27.720
You're not well.

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.000
Just a fever from my travels.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.520
At my age, you grow vulnerable to drafts.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.440
That's a poor lie. You can do better.

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.640
I fear my presence here
endangers your agreement with King Uther.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.360
It's a risk I have to take.
There's no other choice.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.440
There is.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.040
By sating his thirst for revenge,
we might lure out his better angels.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:55.280
How?

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:57.680
Give him me.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.440
What?

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.680
He's longed for my head for some time.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.040
You're mad. No. I forbid it.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.800
With respect, you are Queen of the Fey,
not of Merlin.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.360
I told you I don't want your protection.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.400
Well, I have a terrible habit
of not doing what I'm told.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.000
Something I seem to have passed on
to my kin.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.160
In addition,

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.960
I'm the only member of this court

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.200
who stands any chance
of getting audience with Uther

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.680
and divining his intentions.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.040
If I sense betrayal is afoot,

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.080
I'll do all I can to warn you.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.560
I don't want to see you hurt
because of me.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.320
I don't want anyone else to be hurt
because of me.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:44.960
Well, that's just it.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.040
You've made us all brave.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.880
We haven't had any time.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.160
Never wish for more time.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.120
The gods might hear you
and grant that wish.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.040
And I cannot sway you from this course?

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.560
To know me is to know yourself.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.480
What does he want?

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:42.240
This is no time to declare war
on your own kind.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.400
Pendragon ships are coming
to save all of us. Thanks to Nimue.

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.880
Your queen is a mad dog.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.080
Fey that follow her
are traitors to their kind.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.960
Your man drew first blood,
defied our queen.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.760
She's not our queen.

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.800
And you're sure as hell not my chief.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:08.560
This Man Blood is trying to save
the ungrateful lot of you.

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.360
Don't translate.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.040
He understands me.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:14.720
Don't you, Wroth?

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.600
Because you have a choice here.

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:22.200
You could be the last chief of the Tusks,
who stood his ground in Gramaire

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:26.320
until every last one
of a great warrior clan was slaughtered

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.640
over a blood vow.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.960
Or you could be the first chief
of a new age,

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:35.800
who saved his people, languages,
and rituals for generations to come.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:39.640
Your grandchildren will tell stories
of Wroth the Just,

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.240
Wroth the Wise,

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.920
who chose his people over his pride.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.480
So...

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:49.480
which will it be?

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.720
Blood...

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.920
pays for blood.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.680
Death!

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:00.720
Take mine.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:05.240
Here! If that's what it takes
to save your hides, go on!

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.600
Blood pays for blood.

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:22.880
Stop!

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:31.800
A brave fool

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:33.760
is still a fool.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Nimue?

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:10.840
Who are you?

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:14.520
Answer me.

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.160
You have been touched
by the Cailleach.

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:21.960
- Are you a kind of Shadow Lord?
- She has given you the unnatural sight.

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:25.440
- What did you promise her in return?
- I'm not the unnatural one here.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:28.880
You have been cursed
by Dark Gods, child.

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:30.600
I can help you.

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.800
But only if you tell me the truth.

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.600
I saw you in the infirmary.

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:40.840
I saw your face.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.120
You claim them, don't you?

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.880
You sort of claim the dead somehow.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.440
Wait, why are you in this chamber?

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:52.920
Do not question me!

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.240
And make no effort to interfere,

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.440
or you will see my face again.

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.040
Have you come for Nimue?

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.480
Are...

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.840
- What's wrong? What's happened?
- Nothing.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.080
No, I just got a bit light-headed,
that's all.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.160
- I'm sorry, I shouldn't have come.
- Well, talk to me.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:38.440
Morgana.

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.600
Um...

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.840
I'm leaving.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.000
- What?
- I don't belong here.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.080
- Of course you do.
- No, I'm not one of you.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.240
- I'm not one of them.
- We need you.

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:56.880
I understand what you need to do,
but I have to find another way, Nimue.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.200
- Do you still want to fight?
- Yes.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.040
- For the Fey?
- Yes.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.400
Then come with me.

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:07.080
Nimue.

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:09.840
What's happening?

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.280
Wait, you're escaping?

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:18.640
No.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.160
You are.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:32.760
Help.

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:34.040
Where's Nimue?

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.120
I'm not sure.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.200
What do you need?

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:40.000
Everything.
Snakes are stealing the furniture.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.240
And we need to get those food stores
into the wagons.

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:43.400
Okay.

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:57.000
Fair enough.

00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.040
We ride.

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.080
There you are.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:20.360
Yeah.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.200
They're not very happy about it,

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.800
but the Tusks will ride with us.

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:28.200
That's good news.

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:30.280
You've done well.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:36.920
Nimue.

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:48.360
My hands are shaking.

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:51.760
Please let me stay.

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.840
No. Arthur, I need you with them.

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:58.000
Promise me.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.080
Promise.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000
I promise.

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.000
I'm a bit jealous.

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:16.480
I always wanted to go on a ship.

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.360
Missed mine by a day.

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.120
That was the day we met, actually.

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:25.640
I thought you were in Hawksbridge
for my singing.

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:30.480
You weren't terrible.

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:33.560
I wasn't terrible?
I mean, that's nice of you to say.

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:37.080
You thought you were just
the most devastating thing ever.

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.000
I knew you were a bit treacherous.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.040
I didn't mind that.

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.480
I lost my breath when I saw you.

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.000
You ignore my summons.

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.360
His Grace.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:52.280
I cannot feel it.

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:57.720
I call out to him...

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:03.000
I reach out, and there is only darkness.

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:08.200
You are the avenging sword of light

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:11.600
in pitched battle
against the Lord of Darkness.

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.560
Did you think you could escape his touch?

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:18.760
His corruption?

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.080
The beast

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:23.160
does not tear the flesh,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.440
it tears the soul.

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:27.640
Do you love me, Father?

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:34.600
Of course I do.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.240
Even if I am damned?

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.200
Those are dangerous words.

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:56.040
We will speak of this one last time.

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:00.040
You were demon-born.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.840
An abomination in the eyes of God.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:05.160
But I spared you from the fire

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.720
because you could sense your own kind.

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:12.400
I gave you scripture.

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.520
I gave you discipline.

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:18.000
I forged you
into one of our sharpest blades.

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:20.200
I turned you against your Maker.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:24.480
And I laid the first brick

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.880
on your road to salvation.

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:33.320
But I cannot

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:36.240
walk the road for you, my son.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:39.600
I cannot save you from the flames.

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.840
You have to have the will

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:45.560
to do what is necessary.

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.640
Do you have the will, my son?

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:56.920
Yes, Father.

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:06.240
Then we shall not speak of this again.

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:17.760
- I just found you again, you shit.
- We don't have any choice.

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:19.920
Well, what's gonna happen now?

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:23.120
I don't know.

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:26.880
But if I can, I'll find you.

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.800
- I promise.
- Riders, ready!

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:32.720
How am I the one going
to the bloody desert kingdoms now?

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:36.320
Why does it have to be you?

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:37.880
I'm all right.

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:39.400
I don't care about you.

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:40.800
I'm not all right.

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:48.080
I love you, Pym.

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:51.200
I love you.

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:03.440
Born in the dawn...
Born in the dawn...

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:04.760
To pass in the twi...

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:06.160
To pass in the twilight.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.040
I'll protect them with my life.

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:21.560
I know you will.

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.920
He just showed up at the checkpoint,
Your Majesty.

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:30.080
Hello, Uther.

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:32.840
Dispensed with the formalities, have you?

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:35.920
Are you lying to her?

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:38.960
The Fey girl!

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:42.720
Just tell me what your intentions are.

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:46.080
- Did you send this monkey to lie for you?
- Have you lost your wits?

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.200
Quiet, fool.
The boy can speak for himself.

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:49.760
"Boy," is it?

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.600
You're drunk.

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:57.320
That's not an answer.

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:12.480
I guess my wine has spilled.

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:15.760
Who has done this to you?

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:16.840
No one.

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.440
Just a fisherman.

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.600
I got caught on the wrong hook.

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.240
I would think to find you
in better spirits

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:26.480
on the eve
of your greatest victory as king.

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:31.160
You've ended the Fey slaughter,
subdued the Church,

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:34.960
negotiated a firm but just peace
with the leader of the Fey rebellion,

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:38.320
and despite all of my best efforts
to destroy it,

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:40.440
the Sword of Power is within your grasp.

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:43.480
If you dare try to claim credit for this,
we swear, we...

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:44.520
Not at all.

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:54.360
How's your mother?

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:56.960
Dead.

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:06.960
Then you've done all this by yourself.

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:10.240
Bravo, Uther.

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:11.440
I'm proud of you.

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:17.880
We must confess we have...

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.640
longed to hear these words from you.

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:21.760
I mean them.

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:27.440
The midwife was your mother's crime,
Uther.

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:29.280
Not yours.

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:33.240
If you wish to be recognized
as the one true king,

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:36.040
you still have a chance to earn it.
Your way.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:39.400
Let's end this business
with the sword today.

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:41.240
And so I ask you again:

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.840
What are your intentions
with the Fey girl?

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:47.000
You knew?

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:51.440
You knew all along.

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:53.520
You and her, together.

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:56.600
Let's not dwell on the past, Uther.

00:22:58.520 --> 00:22:59.520
You are the...

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:02.160
king of lies.

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:04.320
Will you keep your word?

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.080
You need your rest.

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:24.360
Get him out of our sight.

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:12.480
A sail!

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:14.800
There... sails.

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:17.240
The king has kept his word.

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:18.920
This is our chance.

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:21.120
She did it.

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:23.680
They have the biggest sails.

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:26.440
She's saved the Fey!

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:38.200
Hello?

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:46.920
Is someone there?

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:20.760
Who's that?

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:38.960
Sir Steuben.

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:41.240
A raven just arrived.

00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:54.120
"Pendragon ships are here. Boarding now."

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:56.600
The king has kept his word.

00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:00.200
"All my love. Arthur."

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:01.800
This pleases me, milady.

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:08.800
They're safe.

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:03.000
My love.

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.400
Are you truly here?

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:07.640
You see me, don't you?

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:11.120
- Yeah, but I don't know what to believe.
- Believe your eyes.

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:13.480
And be grateful for the sight
you've been given.

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:15.840
To see death is a gift for us both.

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:19.920
For I don't feel so alone.

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:22.920
Here.

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:24.800
You're not alone.

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:27.000
I feel so ashamed.

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:27.960
Why?

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:30.160
For doubting you.
For standing in your way.

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.760
No, you never stood in my way.

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:34.480
You knew your destiny,
but it frightened me.

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:38.760
And yet here you are,
on the precipice of all that you seek.

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:41.760
To see between worlds,
to know the shadows' secrets.

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:43.840
Oh, Celia, I fear I'm not ready.

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:46.280
Silly bird,

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:48.600
of course you're not ready.

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:50.640
You've only just begun.

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:54.760
Look at what you've accomplished already.

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:57.200
What have I accomplished?

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:00.760
You have the sword.

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:08.320
Bring the sword
to the temple of the Cailleach,

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:11.320
so that your instruction may begin.
This is how you will save the Fey.

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:13.560
No, it wasn't given to me.

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:16.120
She asked me to hold it for her.

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:18.960
She entrusted me with it.

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:22.240
I know you care for her,

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:25.160
but this is where Nimue's journey ends,

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:26.840
my love.

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:28.960
- I'm so sorry.
- No.

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:31.920
I want to help her,
but the Widow stalks her.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:32.840
No!

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:35.440
A daughter of Death,
there's no escaping her summons.

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:36.520
I have to warn her.

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:37.520
Morgana.

00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:39.360
Morgana!

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:43.080
Don't confront the Widow.
She's not of this world!

00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:51.400
Get rid of the witch!

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:54.080
- Burn her!
- She's evil!

00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:58.160
Witch! Devil! Burn her!

00:28:58.240 --> 00:28:59.080
Horrible!

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:01.240
- Get rid of her!
- Devil witch!

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:15.400
Well?

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:21.440
She doesn't have the sword, Your Majesty.

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:25.440
Why not? Where is it?

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:29.160
I'm...

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:32.360
- It is in...
- Do you think you're very clever?

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:34.720
No. No, Your...

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:37.600
Where's the bloody sword?

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:43.720
She mocks your kindness, Your Majesty.

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:46.120
I wouldn't waste another breath on her.

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:50.720
We are more than capable of drawing out
the location of the sword from her.

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:53.280
Indeed it would be a privilege.

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:55.240
Give us the witch,

00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:58.520
and the sword will be yours by sundown,
Your Highness.

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:05.320
Do you presume us merciful, girl?

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:09.680
You presume wrong.

00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:12.440
You are aware what awaits you

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:16.280
should we hand you over to Father Carden
and his Red Paladins?

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:18.200
Very aware, Your Majesty.

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:22.960
He had my mother killed.

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:26.720
Burned my village down. Burned them all.

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:28.720
I know him well.

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:31.960
And before it is done,

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:36.800
we will humble you before Almighty God,
girl, I swear it.

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:39.040
That's what your boys in Gramaire thought.

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:43.480
And Yvoire Abbey and the Red Lake.

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:45.560
You've emboldened this witch,
Your Majesty.

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:48.520
We will ask you very simply now, girl:

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:51.960
Where's the sword?

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:53.680
You will have your sword.

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:57.280
As soon as the Green Knight and the boy,
Squirrel, are returned to me alive.

00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:03.200
That Fey assassin and his little spy
are our prisoners, Your Majesty.

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:04.520
They're not for trading.

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:06.480
Then you have Squirrel?

00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:08.000
Aye.

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:10.400
And if you don't sing for us,

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:12.000
he most surely will.

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:14.120
Touch him,
and I'll see you choked on your own blood!

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:16.560
- Divine forces protect me, demon.
- Enough!

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:18.360
If my people are not returned,
by the Hidden,

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:20.480
I vow you will never see
the Sword of Power.

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:23.280
Your Majesty,

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:28.720
give her to us.

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:29.800
Torture me.

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:32.640
Skin me to my bones. I'll never tell you.

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:35.920
I'm ready to die, Carden. Are you?

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:38.840
Gods,
it will give us great pleasure

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:40.480
to be rid of you both.

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:42.560
You have your bloody nerve.

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:47.040
To make further demands on us
after we have dealt with you so fairly.

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:49.680
You have my life, Your Highness.

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:54.520
If you want my sword as well,
it comes at a cost.

00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:57.120
<i>Your</i> sword?

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:05.400
Your Majesty,
if Carden takes, Carden's sword...

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:12.960
Take her away and keep her under guard

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:15.640
while we consider these demands.

00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:57.560
Did I not warn you?

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:18.160
Come along. Quick!

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:20.400
In the boat.

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:21.800
Come on! Quickly!

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:24.480
Come on. Quick! Quick! Quick!

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:34.480
Raiders!

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:37.720
Cumber the Ice King's army!
We'll hold them off!

00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:40.760
Pym, Kaze,
get the others to the rocks. Go!

00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:41.760
Go!

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:47.160
To the rocks! This way!

00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:55.880
Wait.

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:06.360
Get ready!

00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:10.120
Slaughter them all!

00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:12.000
For Cumber!

00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:15.440
Charge!

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:34.080
Everyone to the back!

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:35.440
Quick!

00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:40.280
We've cut off the Fey convoy

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:42.640
from boarding the Pendragon ships,
Lord Cumber.

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:44.880
There will be no survivors.

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:48.880
You have kept your promise
to the Red Paladins.

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:12.680
There are more of them coming!

00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:14.880
Fall back to the cliffs!

00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:19.840
Look! More Viking ships!

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:22.160
No! It's the Red Spear!

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:27.720
There! You see?

00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:41.520
Yeah!

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:44.000
Wroth!

00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:50.080
Hey! Get up. Come on.

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:53.200
Wroth, get up.

00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:03.040
Protect them.

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:22.200
As I speak these words,

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:26.400
my sister Dagmar is butchering
the last of the Fey on the Beggar's Coast.

00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:29.560
The Church looks forward
to its partnership with the Ice King.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.560
We agreed.
The witch and her kind for the sword.

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:35.840
But I'm told she came empty-handed.

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:37.360
Uther indulges her.

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:41.000
He debases the crown
by catering for the she-devil.

00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:44.120
But a few hours with us,
and she'll soon know her place.

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:45.960
Spill her secrets.

00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:56.040
Uther Pendragon,

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:57.880
the false king,

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:01.240
has chosen the Fey over God.

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:03.120
No!

00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:06.080
Should his men raise their swords
against you,

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:07.960
defend yourselves.

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:09.880
Kill who you must.

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:13.080
Just bring me the Wolf-Blood Witch.

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:15.120
Yeah!

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:32.560
Kill all Cumber's raiders,

00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:34.680
but leave Dagmar to me!

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:49.920
Stay here!

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:13.360
Red Spear!

00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:15.360
For the Red Spear!

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:31.480
Cumber can't protect you now.

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:12.360
The Ice King's throne will be mine!

00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:14.240
Tell your sister Eydis

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:15.960
she's next!

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:44.000
Shall we play now?

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:45.720
You're the ugliest of them all.

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:46.880
Inside and out.

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:50.040
Kill me, fine.
But you'll still be you forever.

00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:52.560
That's a worse hell
than anything I can think of.

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:02.000
The tongue first, I think.

00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:06.320
Go on. Take it. I'll still keep talking.

00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:09.280
I'll be in your nightmares talking,
telling you how ugly you are.

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:11.520
When you try and wake up,
your eyes won't open

00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:13.760
'cause you sewed them up
like a bloody idiot!

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:18.920
Who is there?

00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:27.600
Come to watch, my weeping brother?

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:54.760
Here's the bag of shit you ordered.

00:40:57.960 --> 00:40:59.520
Gawain.

00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:00.440
Gawain.

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:03.760
Gawain?

00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:06.200
Gawain.

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:08.240
Gawain?

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:11.640
Gawain?

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:14.280
No.

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:15.200
No!

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:18.120
Not you. Not you!

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:20.960
Gawain! No!

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:22.440
Gawain!

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:04.520
The paladins are attacking! To arms!

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:05.720
Find the witch!

00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:22.680
I wouldn't.

00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:27.880
Does he remind you of someone?

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:30.720
This Fey orphan?

00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:33.680
- You don't need him.
- Why?

00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:38.760
Can't he smell out his own kind
like some kind of animal?

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:42.520
Or is that just your species?

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:44.960
Find cover.

00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:51.120
You do have a reputation,

00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:53.720
but this is the Trinity Guard.

00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:56.040
You know their skill.

00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:06.160
So be it.

00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:14.880
She's here.

00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:01.640
Who's first?

00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:42.240
Come on! We have to go.

00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:43.560
Come on!

00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:46.320
Get up!

00:45:57.080 --> 00:45:58.000
Come on.

00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:12.080
We found her.

00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:16.560
- Get off!
- Kill the witch!

00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:18.760
Slay the Wolf-Blood Witch!

00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:25.000
Hold her!

00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:31.240
We delay God's justice no longer.

00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:34.600
Sword or no sword, tonight...

00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:36.480
we send you back to Hell.

00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:49.160
What evil is this?

00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:56.520
Witchcraft!

00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:03.560
What are you?

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:08.800
I'm the Widow.

00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:41.760
Morgana?

00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:45.720
- What happened to you?
- I don't know.

00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:47.280
I killed her, and...

00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:49.440
then I became her.

00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:52.720
Now I can feel who's about to die.

00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:56.400
It's Merlin.

00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:03.640
Yes.

00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:05.680
Yes.

00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:09.800
No.

00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:13.120
Merlin?

00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:17.360
Go.

00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:21.400
No. You're coming with us.

00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:28.080
Why can't I die?

00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:49.560
Somebody help me here.

00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:57.400
I owe you a debt.

00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:58.880
For that arrow.

00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:00.840
I'm glad to hear it.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.040
Consider us even.

00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:06.440
I am the Red Spear,

00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:08.960
exile of the court of Cumber the Ice King.

00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:11.560
A court now under siege by traitors.

00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:13.400
I'm Arthur.

00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:16.320
We'll do all in our power
to help your people...

00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:19.080
if you help save our queen.

00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:25.360
If we make it to Rabbit's Cross,
we can lose them in the narrows.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:33.960
Come on.

00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:01.080
Leave me.

00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:04.240
Leave me!

00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:12.600
I can't go any further.

00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:15.560
Rest here.

00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:19.640
You watch over him.

00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:21.160
I'm going back for Squirrel.

00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:25.960
Iris?

00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:31.400
Iris, stop!

00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:33.440
No!

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.080
No, no, no! No!

00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:51.040
No! No!

00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:11.680
Nimue.

00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:13.280
Father.

00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:18.040
No!

00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:23.880
No!

00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:27.000
No!

00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:12.680
What was your name, boy?

00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:14.880
Squirrel.

00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:19.560
A squirrel is an animal.

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:22.360
What name were you given?

00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:25.520
I don't like that name.

00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:28.280
It's still your name.

00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:31.440
Fine.

00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:32.640
It's Percival.

00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:36.640
Percival.

00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:40.600
Do you have a real name?

00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:45.160
Lancelot.

00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:49.280
A long time ago, my name was Lancelot.

00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:14.200
Out of the darkness,
there always comes a light,

00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:17.200
blinding in its clarity,

00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:20.320
searing in its strength,

00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:24.840
pure as our Lord God is pure.

00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:28.120
For make no mistake,

00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:31.400
to smite the Wolf-Blood Witch,

00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:35.000
God has sent us his own avenging angel.

00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:39.880
Today, we add to the ranks of the Trinity

00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:43.800
a new warrior of God.

00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:46.640
Rise...

00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:48.920
Sister Iris.

00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:00.360
Together,

00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:04.040
we shall accomplish great miracles,
my child.

00:56:05.305 --> 00:57:05.849
